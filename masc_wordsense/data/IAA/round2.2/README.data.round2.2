README.mascSenseIA.rounds2-5.data.round2.2

The data files are in the format required by Ron Artstein's
calculate-alpha.perl script

From his script documentation:
### <data-file> is a tab-separated text file: the first line is
### annotator id's separated by tabs, and subsequent lines are
### annotation data, with each line representing a single item, and
### individual values separated by tabs. Values must be numeric;

annotators: 101, 102, 103, 105, 107, 108
sentences: N=100 per word; see round2.2-fair-j-sentences.txt, etc.
words (N=10): fair-j, know-v, land-n, long-j, quiet-j, say-v, show-v, tell-v, time-n, work-n
