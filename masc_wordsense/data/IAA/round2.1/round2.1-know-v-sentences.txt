i don't know i'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow
and there were sounds of things breaking and you know you look you know we at one point we woke up to the sound of the uh the electric lines being ripped off our house and
you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now
you know
yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood
and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities
and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and
i mean they were good but i you know you couldn't deny that but i didn't i thought you know well i just didn't really care for either one of them uh today my favorites out of those guys were probably um
uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise
it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it yeah i find too that i have more energy when i exercise and i and uh you know it's silly not to but i don't know
you know we're afraid of you you don't you don't look like we do you don't talk like we do so we're going to move you out
you know they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer you know i presently i used to have a two eighty Z and i'm a tall guy and and uh

and so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know

show that there's a reason for you know for suspecting that person

i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort
so it was kind of nice i don't know if those are still available or not but
and you don't know where it's gonna end uh
oh i don't either and you can go to a store and pick out which one you want and just you know it's it's weird to have something like that you know i've never been a hunter or been around anything like that that
well i've still all three of my daughters are married but i don't know i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time and some of them coming back home and things you know
